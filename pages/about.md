## About We Exist

*We Exist: African Americans' Education and Employment in Maine* is the fifth of a six-part digital exhibit series.

We are indebted to our partners at the Osher Map Library (OML), University of Southern Maine (USM) Special Collections, and University of Southern Maine Libraries for their support in digitizing and building the exhibit site. This site was built by USM Libraries and Digital Projects staff. Mary Holt (Digital Projects Manager) administrator for the USM Digital Commons facilitated construction and organization of the exhibit; Paul Fuller (Digital Projects Associate) assisted with photographing many of the images featured in the exhibit;. Special thanks and gratitude are in order for Susie Bock (Coordinator of USM Special Collections and Director of the Jean Byers Sampson Center for Diversity in Maine) Zach Newell (Dean of Libraries and Learning), and Libby Bischof, Executive Director of the OML. Dr. Lance Gibbs served as the research lead for the project, providing historical background from news and scholarly references, and authoring the short contextual catalogue essay entries which complement the photos, written, and audio galleries.
